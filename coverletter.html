						<h5 class="bold">Bachelor of Arts Honors - English</h5>
						<span class="fs-12">I acquired my BAH with a major in English in spring of 2017. Since my graduation, my focus has shifted from the study of language to a focus on technology. Despite this shift, my time spent earning this degree generated a lifelong interest in writing and communications. While working towards this degree, I had aspirations of working in journalism. These aspirations remain, but at this point in time I consider my writing to be more of a hobby than a professional interest. Despite this shift, I firmly believe that this background is a valuable supplement to my technological knowledge.</span>
					</div>
					<div class="fs-14">
						<h5 class="bold">Bachelor of Science 4yr. - Computer Science (in progress)</h5>
						<span class="fs-12">During my tenure as an English major, I took many electives which helped qualify me towards a Computer Science degree. By the time of my convocation, I was already registered in a full-time regiment of summer classes working towards my second degree. At the time of writing, I am only four classes shy of my computer science degree, but I have put my degree on hold to participate in the Computer Science Professional Internship Program (CSPIP). This has resulted in my current position with Federated Co-operatives Limited as a Web Developer. I hope to work in professional web development following my graduation.</span>

					<div class="fs-14">
						<h5 class="bold">Programming</h5>
						<span class="fs-12">I have experience with a wide variety of programming languages and libraries. At this point in time, my strongest programming languages are JavaScript and Java geared towards web development. I also have substantial programming experience with C and Python. Furthermore, I firmly believe that the breadth of my knowledge regarding programming fundamentals and my experience with multiple languages helps me to quickly learn and adopt whatever languages may be required. Currently, I am very interested in learning both golang and PHP. Lastly, I am familiar with common programming supplemental tools such as version control (git and SVN), various IDEs (including Android Studio, Eclipse, and RAD), and database </span>
					</div>
					<div class="fs-14">
						<h5 class="bold">Web Development</h5>
						<span class="fs-12">My experience with web development spans many languages and frameworks. I am proficient with HTML, CSS (including Bootstrap), JavaScript (including jQuery, TypeScript, Vue, and Angular), and Java (including the Spring framework). I am familiar with IBM Websphere Portal Web Content Management system. I believe that my familiarity with Websphere as well as my experience working in professional web development should provide me with a strong foundation for learning other web content management systems such as Drupal and Wordpress. Currently, I am interested in learning to develop using the React JavaScript framework</span>

				<div id="comDetails" class="collapse">
					<div class="fs-14">
						<h5 class="bold">Writing & Documentation</h5>
						<span class="fs-12">I have confidence in my ability to produce both technical and non-technical writing. During the scope of my education, I have been responsible for creating technical documentation for my assignments, class projects, and my work during my internship. </span>
					</div>
					<div class="fs-14">
						<h5 class="bold">Collaboration</h5>
						<span class="fs-12">Many of my computer science classes focused upon collaborative development with a team of students. I have learned to thrive on teams of all sizes and I believe I am excellent at finding my niche and fitting into the team. Currently, I work on a team of approximately twelve developers.</span>
					</div>
					<div class="fs-14">
						<h5 class="bold">Tools</h5>
						<span class="fs-12">I am comfortable using the full suite of Microsoft Office 365 products, Google Docs, and other collaborative tools. While my experience varies from product to product, I have no hesitation regarding learning and using new software. </span>
